<objective>
Guide new users through Personal OS setup: collect identity/business/voice context through sequential questions, let them choose an elemental creature companion, and populate context files.
</objective>

<usage>
```
/onboard              # Start fresh onboarding
/onboard --creature   # Just change creature selection
/onboard --reset      # Re-run full onboarding (overwrites existing)
```
</usage>

<essential_principles>
1. **One question at a time:** Use AskUserQuestion for each step, never batch questions
2. **Everything skippable:** Every question can be skipped (except creature selection)
3. **Graceful degradation:** Scraping failures → offer manual input or skip
4. **Immediate payoff:** First calibration after onboarding hatches the egg
5. **Progressive disclosure:** Only load references when needed for specific workflows
</essential_principles>

<dependencies>
**Run these checks before anything else. Block onboarding if critical deps missing.**

```bash
# Beads (required) - task tracking
which bd >/dev/null 2>&1 || echo "MISSING: bd"

# PyYAML (required) - schema validation
python3 -c "import yaml" 2>/dev/null || echo "MISSING: pyyaml"
```

**If Beads missing:**
> Beads is required for task tracking. Install it with:
> ```
> brew tap steveyegge/beads
> brew install bd
> ```
> Then run `/onboard` again.

**If PyYAML missing:**
> PyYAML is required for schema validation. Install it with:
> ```
> pip install pyyaml
> ```
> Then run `/onboard` again.

Only proceed if both checks pass.
</dependencies>

<quick_start>
1. **Check dependencies** — block if missing (see `<dependencies>`)
2. Check if context files exist → route appropriately
3. Get their name via AskUserQuestion
4. Welcome with rundown of what's coming (~3-5 min)
5. Creature selection (required): Fire egg, Water egg, or Nature egg
6. Business context (skippable): website URL or quick questions
7. Role selection (skippable): founder, engineer, designer, etc.
8. Primary use case (skippable): what they want help with
9. Writing samples (skippable) → analyze → voice-and-style.md
10. Image generation setup (optional) → Gemini API key
11. Call recording setup (optional) → Granola sync daemon
12. Generate context files from collected data
13. Explain how /task, /calibrate, /today work
14. Show creature + personalized welcome banner
15. GitHub CLI auth (optional): `gh auth login` for GitHub features
16. ⭐ Ask about starring the repo (optional): auto-star if authed, else manual link
17. Commit with /commit
18. Suggest `/today` to start first daily note
</quick_start>

<routing>
| Condition | Workflow |
|-----------|----------|
| No context files exist | workflows/fresh-start.md |
| Context files exist, no --reset | Ask: overwrite/merge/cancel |
| --creature flag | workflows/creature-select.md |
| --reset flag | workflows/fresh-start.md (force) |
| Resume from interrupted | Load .claude/onboard-state.json, continue |
</routing>

<creatures>
User selects an elemental egg. The creature inside hatches after first calibration (10 traces).

| Element | Egg | Creature | Theme |
|---------|-----|----------|-------|
| 🔥 Fire | Red/Orange | **Ember** | Burns through blockers, iterates fast |
| 💧 Water | Blue | **Drift** | Flows around obstacles, adaptable |
| 🌿 Nature | Green | **Bloom** | Grows organically, cultivates knowledge |

**Evolution stages:**
| Level | Traces | Stage |
|-------|--------|-------|
| 1 | 0-9 | Egg |
| 2 | 10-99 | Hatchling |
| 3 | 100-499 | Juvenile |
| 4 | 500-1499 | Adult |
| 5 | 1500+ | Legendary |

Creature art stored in `.claude/creatures/{name}/{stage}.txt`
</creatures>

<granola_setup>
**Step 11: Call Recording Setup (Optional)**

Check if Granola is installed:
```bash
[ -f "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Granola/cache-v3.json" ] && echo "installed"
```

If installed, ask via AskUserQuestion:
> "Granola detected! Want to auto-sync meeting notes to your vault? (Recommended)"
> - Yes, set it up
> - No, skip

If yes:
```bash
cd services/granola-sync && ./install.sh
```

If not installed, skip silently (don't mention Granola to users who don't have it).
</granola_setup>

<context_files>
Files populated during onboarding:

| File | Primary Source | Fallback |
|------|---------------|----------|

| brain/context/business.md | Company website | Business type Qs |
| brain/context/voice-and-style.md | Writing samples | Template only |
| brain/context/preferences.md | Use case selection | Defaults |

Templates in: `.claude/skills/onboard/templates/`
</context_files>

<error_handling>
| Error | Recovery |
|-------|----------|
| Website scrape fails | "Couldn't load that—no worries, I'll ask a couple questions instead" |
| Invalid URL | Show example, re-ask |
| Session interrupted | Save to .claude/onboard-state.json, resume on next /onboard |
| All questions skipped | Create minimal files with TODOs |
| API key invalid | Validate format, offer to re-enter or skip |
</error_handling>

<references_index>
| Reference | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
